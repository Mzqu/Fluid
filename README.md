## Fluid

A **clean** and **color-coded** home page for all your web browsing needs. Use macros to quickly reach
the sites you want.

## Macros?

You can define your own in **macros.js**, where a template is provided. To use one, type the keyword into the
text bar. For example, typing **reddit** and pressing Enter will go to https://reddit.com. Typing **reddit programming**
will go to https://reddit.com/r/programming. By default, Fluid includes macros for Google, Bing, Facebook, Reddit, and Gmail.

## Motivation

It's a pain to type out entire URLs into the address bar, and dynamic bookmarks aren't possible for sites with many pages, like reddit, where you want to go to many different subs efficiently.

## Installation

Download the project and make the home.html your home page. Fully customizable macros, colors, and background image.

## Made with

Fluid is made with Angular.js, HTML, and Javascript.
